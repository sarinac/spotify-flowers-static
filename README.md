# spotify-flowers (static version) ðŸŒ¸ ðŸŒ¹ ðŸŒº

This repository exists only for hosting a static version of my work. The real work is [here](https://github.com/sarinac/spotify-flowers).

## Instructions

### Set up a Web Server
If not using Flask, remove the `static` directory from the file path for the Worker object in `flowers.js`. Then run the following command in the terminal.
```
python -m http.server 8000 &
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to access the file in `app/static/sample.html`.
